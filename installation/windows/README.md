# Windows Installation Package

The Windows installation package provides three batch files that serve different purposes:

1. An installation file `install_fortran.bat` to install Fortran on your Windows computer.
2. A file `uninstall_fortran.bat` that completely removes the Fortran installation from your computer.
3. A file `update_toolbox.bat` that fill compile and copy the latest version of our toolbox to your system.
